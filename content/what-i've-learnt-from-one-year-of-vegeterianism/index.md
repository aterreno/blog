Last winter while reading Scott Jurek Eat and Run I took the decision to go Vegeterian, here’s a write up of my ‘experience’. 

**Where it all** 

I never even considered becoming vegeterian, I am from Italy and I grew up in Piedmont, where meat is one of the pillars of not only the local cousine but also of the overall economy.   
The argument from Scott’s book that got me over the line was the recovery times, he writes:

> _I was eating more, losing weight, and gaining muscle — all on avegan diet. My recovery times between workouts and races got even shorter. I wasn’t even sore the day after 50-mile races._

I was sold, since January 2019 I didn’t had a single steak of rib, whenever I have an easy, tasty choice I opt for vegan food, otherwise I am now a vegeterian. 

**Did it work?** 

Now, here there is a culprit, I also trained ‘properly’ for the first time in my life, so part of the overall gain in my health and recovery times might be due to also this new approach to my fitness. However there are a few clear and obvious positive consequences of my diet: 

-   I didn’t get sick any more, litterally not even a sneeze, while the previous year I had a few colds and a sinusitis a couple of times. I can only think that all the vegetables and fruits I had helped me fighting bugs. I also found helpful to do a netipot whenever some minor signs of cold appeared.
-   I slept better. I often had nights with sweats or just plain bad sleep, but eating a balanced vegetarian diet made me sleep better and more regularly. 
-   I trained better. I think I’ve read that again on Scott’s book, but basically the main gain of eating easily digestible food is that you are ready to train any time, you don’t have to wait a couple of hours to wait for the food to be processed. That is a massive win, especially when you have to balance family and work and keeping it flexible. 
-   I definitely did recover better, at peak training I also made smoothies taking recipies from Eat and Run. 

**Other major, even more important consequences**

In my mind, compared to my body, some bigger changes happened, it started to optimise my own training but it quickly became something bigger. I involved my family into this and I started to become more and more aware of the issues with Livestock Farming and the correlation with global warming.

I barely drink alchool as well, again, all of these changes are correlated to each other, train more, eat green, drins less, train more, eat even healtiher, drink even less. 

I litterally cannot stand animal food righ now, it’s really interesting, I feel like somehow meat is addictive, almost similar to tobacco, I did smoke a little at high school, now I hate smoke. I feel the same way about this, I can’t stand smoke, neither can I now stand looking at a dead chicken or a boody steak.
