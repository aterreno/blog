The well-known Italian computer magazine Dev. published an article on Antonio Terreno’s innovation, which makes it possible to cache data on mobile devices. Now, users can store static information on the mobile phone or PDA via a Java application and, with every refresh, download only new information. This process helps reduce transfer costs. Additionally, Antonio Terreno was interviewed by Dev. about his new project kommons. The aim of the project is to provide a library consisting of a set of useful, reusable JavaME classes for making logs, I/O, data persistence, etc. on connected limited devices. Thus, it is easier to develop mobile applications (MIDlets).
