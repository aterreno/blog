It’s a [popular news in these days](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/29/cloud.computing.richard.stallman), Stallman doesn’t like cloud computing, he thinks it’s just a way to steal data from users. He’s clearly wrong, it’s a clear example on how fanatism (even for right causes like privacy, free software, etc.) can lead to a stupid war against something which is actually good.

Every web site hosted somewhere then should just close?

Shall I close my blog and put it on a server at home, with high encryption on every data?

Cmon Stallmann, the benefits of cloud computing are evident, and if you hate google or amazon ec2 you can buy cheap cloud power from other providers (like [mosso](http://www.mosso.com/) for instance).
