Finally I’ve moved to Vienna, still working for [Fluidtime](http://www.fluidtime.com/ "Fluidtime GmbH"), from now less flights from Italy, more fun here :-).

I’m also tryng to move to Linux but in any case Windows looks still better for some super programs like itunes & the connection with ipod, music brainz tagger and the client evolution on linux cannot update remote icals on the web…  
Even if I’m using right now [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/ "Google Calendar"), yet another cool ajax super apps from the Google team…

Also the development for J2ME is too bad on linux and since I’m developing also a Bluetooth media content sender I’ve expected that the Bluetooth stack is faster and better on Windows (I’m using avetana bluetooth implementation). This is very strange and I’ve still to investigate on it.

In any case the best solution will be to switch to Mac… I know… For the moment it’s a dream… Will be reality asap…
