My friend [Bruno](http://bbossola.wordpress.com/) kicked off, silently few weeks ago the Java Essential project.  
   
What is Java Essential?  
   
It’s an open, collaborative book, written in Italian about Java and not only.   
It will cover topics like TDD, Object Oriented Design and Domain Driven Design, and all the most current/good/trendy frameworks.  
  
It will be written in Italian, for the Italian Java (not only Java really…) community, written by the communities, in fact various good guys from various different Java User Groups and Organizations will write the content.  
   
I’ve been asked to write the chapter about Domain Driven and since I’m not a good writer I’ve asked to [Floyd Marinescu](http://www.floydmarinescu.com/) if I can translate his nice Domain Driven Design Quickly, and he agreed.  
   
Depending on how much it will take and on how much time I’ll be able to allocate on this project I’ll translate partially the book for Java Essential or the full book, linking it then on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/).  
  
If there’s one thing that I care about is to spread around the world what we do and how we do it, last year I had in total four speeches in Rome, Turin, Varese and Bologna, since I’m a bit far from Europe now, that’s the best way to continue in that direction :-)
