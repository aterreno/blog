[Twitter](http://twitter.com/) is a WEB 2.0 web application, after registering you have an account and you can write what you are doing, so your friends (well, let’s say everybody in this world) will know what the hell are you doing…

It’s actually well done, with an [RSS](http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline/655073.rss) interface, integration with [IM](http://twitter.com/devices), can be used from a phone (only US at the moment), a Mac OS [application](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/31609) and a [widget](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/email_messaging/twidgettwitterdashboardwidget.html) exist already and it has some public [REST](http://twitter.com/help/api) api to call…

Can be useful to track what is doing one resource in a team, especially on distributed agile teams.. Don’t you think? Even if it was designed for stealing your privacy!!!

And… Not a beta for this time…
