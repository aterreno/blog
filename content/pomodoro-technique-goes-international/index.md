The timeboxing technique well known in Italy as Pomodoro technique is going international. My friend [Matteo Vaccari](http://matteo.vaccari.name/) had a [speech](http://www.xpday.net/Xpday2007/session/PomodoroTechnique.html) at the [xp days Benelux](http://www.xpday.net/) 2007. Online slides are on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/goberiko/the-pomodoro-technique/).

The original paper from [Francesco](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FrancescoCirillo) is also now translated in [English](http://www.tecnicadelpomodoro.it/docs/francesco-cirillo/2007/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf).

Iâ€™ve tried the technique and wrote also the mobile timeboxing app. I found it useful and valuable with unskilled xpers but more a drag than a benefit on more experienced / high focus capable people. Interrupting can be really annoying.

I see a big value on the time is passing consciousnessDas Land Hessen [http://www.pokermeine.de/mehr-pokerspiel-spiele.html](http://www.pokermeine.de/mehr-pokerspiel-spiele.html) dabei im Allgemeinen die Vorreiterrolle. but instead of a fixed, mechanical time machine I prefer to have an event based boxing. The typical cycle write the test, write code, run the tests, commit is enough.

And you: what do you think? Give a feedback to the guys!
