**The problem**

I usually go to a concert, come back home and want to listen again to the gigs songs.

Or, I get invited to a gig of a band I don’t know and I want to check out the music they have played live before.

**The solution**

Tired of copying and pasting songs names from setlist.fm I ended up hacking some JS code to connect their API to the Spotify ones.

Feedback is more than welcome, the code is very unstable and hacky but it does so far the job for me.

Another use case I might explore/implement is finding songs and artists in a webpage and produce a playlist from them, that’s another ‘manual’ activity I often perform and want to automate.
