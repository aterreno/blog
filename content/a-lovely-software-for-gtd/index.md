I always used a text file for my todo list, I never found something better than moving lines coping and pasting, nothing so easy and immediate.

I’ve tried for a while [tadalist](http://www.tadalist.com/)Â which is cool since it goes on the web, you can share it, it has an RSS interface, but the usability wasn’t so great.

Yesterday searching for a software that I’ve seen on the [Gaz](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gazjones) Mac I’ve found another one,Â [iGTD](http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/)

The guy says:

> You are a busy person, aren’t you? And there’s an easy way to track all things that have to be done… and to get those things done! **iGTD** takes some concepts from Getting Things Done methodology and makes them easy to understand and use in your every day life. But it’s definitely not limited to the GTD concept — you can really use it the way you want.

It’s simply one of the best Mac Os apps I’ve ever seen, I try to list here what I love of it so far:

-   Export to iCal: awesome
-   Easy to use, simple, logical, keyboard shortcuts for everything
-   Integration with Quick Silver: cool
-   Widget, integration with almost all the apps
-   It’s free

Are you still reading this? Let’s [try it](http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/downloads/index.html) out!
