Day by day I’m always more .net infected, today I’ve found 4 good links. One is [DZone](http://www.dzone.com/ "Fresh links for developers") which provides good quality links every day. From here I found [this](http://www.javabeat.net/javabeat/java6/articles/2007/06/java-6-0-new-features-part-1/ "Java 6.0 new features") where the author tries to convince the reader that Java 6.0 has something cool and new inside… Bah!

Through the good mailing list on Yahoo about [Domain Driven Development](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/domaindrivendesign/messages "DDD") I’ve read this [article](http://iancooper.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!844BD2811F9ABE9C!397.entry "Being Ignorant with LINQ to SQL") about using LINQ, DDD and so on with .net, indeed.

And while writing the post, always through DZone I see that [JRuby 1.0 is out](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/06/jruby10 "JRuby 1.0").

So more than a .net infection maybe is a Java depression.
