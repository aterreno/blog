The title of the previous post "Some stuff you might try in your team" perhaps was catchy or maybe finally I wrote something interesting since I’ve got a big jump of visits, so I go on with a similar title, talking about retrospectives and let’s see how it goes :-)

There are two things that I’m doing right now when I run a retrospective:

The short version of the prime directive, aka the Toni Directive and a bit of time boxing.

The original version of the prime directive says:

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

It’s too long! It takes ages to read it and in my opinion is less effective than a simple, concise, direct:

1.  No blame thanks
2.  We are all sure that every one did his best

That’s it, I was bored when listening to the [orginal, long version](http://www.retrospectives.com/pages/retroPrimeDirective.html), I didn’t see any blame running retros with this version neither people judging. You can try and let me know.

What about time boxing?

Well it cames after a (too) long retrospective run by me, [The Kua](http://www.thekua.com/) came and told me, why not time boxing the next one?

So right now we are trying to fit our weekly/2 weeks retrospectives in half an hour, of course for an end of project retro this might be not enough.

But as a general recommendation, keep an eye on the clock, try to stop people when the conversation goes too long without adding any value, try to find an action quickly and effectively.
