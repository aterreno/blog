I’ve generated the [fortune files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28program%29) from the old good [pragmatic tips](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/extracts/rule_list.html), in order to use [them](http://java2me.org/pragmaticfortune.zip) you need the [fortune wordpress widget](http://www.jason.mock.ws/wordpress/2007/02/15/fortune-widget-03). And this is the main reason also for the restyling of the layout of my blog… I guess the 4th… My previous theme wasn’t widget compatible… That generated a widget obsession, so I have a flickr and a last.fm widget here on the right now…
