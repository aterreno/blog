Nice read, great data backup.

Good job on changing the image, I’ve met ages ago with Greg Wilkins, he and his wife Jan Bartel (used or still do I think!) live in Coletta, Liguria, Italy and remote work from there.

I think the next step from remote work is work and live in small , human centric communities, possibly positioned in ideal weather like Coletta.
