I don’t like the term weekly.  
It sounds fixed, it does not sound agile.

Used in contexts such a weekly meeting: do you really need a meeting every week? I would rather consider to have a meeting as needed, when there’s a real problem, when the benefit is evident.

A weekly status report? Why? Why not pulling the status of the project directly from your continuous integration system or from your tracking tool (Mingle? Track?).

A weekly catch up? Why not having informal catch ups, only as needed, only when there’s something to talk about it?

A weekly release? Why not releasing as soon as you have working software, why breaking your work flow in weekly iterations?

I worked in a project where there was the bad habit of a weekly commit (!), on Friday late afternoon, to close the week.

I worked in a project where there was a weekly remote standup meeting, nothing more useless and boring: people talking at the phone and no one listening.

Weekly doesn’t sounds good for nothing, not for iterations, not for releases, not for meetings.

A [Value Stream Map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_Stream_Mapping) might help you to understand if your weekly commitments are really giving you value or not.
