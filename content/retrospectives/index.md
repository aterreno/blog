Retrospectives are ok. But how many, how much retrospective we need?

One every end of iteration? How long is your iteration? One week? Then maybe is too much. One at the end of the project? Then maybe is too late. As always in medio stat virtus or [Lagom Ã¤r bÃ¤st](http://blog.java2me.org/2007/01/24/lagom-learning-swedish/).

How many then?

I have the idea that in the beginning of every project there’s more need for retrospectives, in the middle of the project the team is in a state of high productivity (should be at least!) that a retro is just a waste of time and in the end, to double check how the situation is progressing and for planning next actions, in order to delivery last stories without pain and then go live.

Flexibility, PM/IM insight, experience and so on should drive the number, a fixed number is just not agile.Â
