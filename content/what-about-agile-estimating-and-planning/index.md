The best place to start to read something about this stuff is without any doubts the MountainGoat Website, of Mike Cohn. There you can find all his [presentations](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/presentation_index) and a lot of articles.

About Planning for example [this](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/presentation/access/40) is a really good presentation, after this I am sure that youâ€™ll buy and read his great book: [Agile Estimating and Planning.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131479415/sr=1-1/qid=1153754433/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9157010-4329607?ie=UTF8&s=books)
