I recently had a conversation with a project manager, who was asking me (tech lead on the project) if I was on top of everything and if everything was under control.   
We are due to go live in a couple of weeks and we finished the development almost a week ago, we run some performance tests and fixed a couple of issues, we deployed the system on the live servers already and everything is fine.

Well I smiled at the project manager, failure happens, what if an heart-quake will destroy both of the data centres were the application will be deployed?   
Damn! We won’t be live that day! Will the world end? Nope.

Failure happens, day by day, iteration by iteration, release by release and even if you’ve done everything right…

Be ready to fail and keep in mind that failure is there ready to hit you, the only thing you can do instead of worrying is mitigating the risks and prioritise your actions against it.
