Finally I have some time to write about it!

I’m organizing for the second year the [Javaday in Turin](http://www.javadaytorino.com) with the [Java User Group Turin Coordinators](http://www.jugtorino.it/vqwiki/jsp/Wiki?WelcomePage) and a little help from some friends… And we are almost done! The conference will be on the 20th of October.

What’s the [Javaday](http://www.javaday.it/)?

> The Javaday is an initiative organized by the Italian Java User Groups, by the community of [Java Italian Portal](http://www.javaportal.it/) and by the [Java Italian Association](http://www.jia.it/) with the goal to promote the knowledge and the usage of the Java technology. Javaday is an on road gig that touches different Italian cities all along the peninsula, spreading the Java technology also in places usually skipped out by big events. This feature makes the Javaday a qualifying and unique moment: every single stage is a direct communication channel in which the technology, the local institutions, the developers and the companies can meet together in order to know each other, share knowledge, compare each other and understand the new opportunities offered by the Java Platform. The participation to the Javaday is free.

This year we expect more people than the 100 we had last year, we have some very interesting speeches,Â the [Java User Group Padova](http://www.jugpadova.it/) talking about their creature, [Parancoe](http://www.parancoe.org/), Simone Federici from Java Italian Portal talking about Spring with [Terracotta DSO](http://www.terracotta.org/) and Alberto Lagna talking about the third generation web services and many more, have a look on the website!

I’ll recycle my speech about Domain Driven Design that I had this summer at the [Essap](http://essap.dicom.uninsubria.it/) :-)

Organizing a conference it’s an incredible experience where the stress is almost well balanced by the final satisfaction. Let’s see how it goes this year!

A special thanks to [Victor Zambrano](http://frwrd.net/) that designed the [Javaday Brochure](http://blog.java2me.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/javaday-depliant-v2h.pdf "Javaday Brochure") and the posters, to [Mariachiara Martina](http://www.martina.to.it/) helping us with the communications and the great Java Italian Community, we all did a great job, driven by passion.
