Here some presentations about it [Chariot Solutions | Presentations](http://www.chariotsolutions.com/javalab/presentations.jsp), well after 1.5 days spent (just for fun) to try RoR I still prefere somthing like Appfuse (or in any case a combination of WebWork + Hibernate or Ibatis + Spring).

Many reasons, first of all with ruby it’s more what you write on the console than on the code… Ok it’s fine to do not have huge classes and methods… But is this the proper way?

Another thing that I never liked of ruby is the syntax, for the html pages (.rhtml…) is fine and pretty… For the code… Mhmm… I still prefer the Java/.net Style.

Some people talk badly about performance and scalability…

I definitely prefer Ruby and Ruby on Rails to Php, on this I have no doubts and I hope that It will become the standard as php is now for the web, in the end you’re more forced to develop with an OO design and some good practices…
