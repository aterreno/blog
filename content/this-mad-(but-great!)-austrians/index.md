There’s a lot of crazyness in Vienna, [art installations](http://www.kunsthallewien.at/), [Hundertwasser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedensreich_Hundertwasser) buildings, but the [Republic of The Kugelmugel](http://www.republik-kugelmugel.com/)… I’ve discovered it just today :-D

> **Kugelmugel** is a [micronation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation "Micronation") located in [Vienna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"), [Austria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria "Austria").

> In [1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984 "1984"), the [artist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist "Artist") [Edwin Lipburger](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edwin_Lipburger&action=edit "Edwin Lipburger") built a ball-shaped house with a barbed-wire fence around it on a small plot in the [Vienna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") [Prater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater "Prater") and declared its independence as the **Republic of Kugelmugel** (the name referring to the [shape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel "Kugel")). The only address within the proclaimed Republic is "2, Antifaschismusplatz" (_2, Anti-Fascism Square_, 2 refers to the 2nd district Leopoldstadt), and the founder is one of the 389 citizens. He refused to pay taxes to the Austrian government and began to print his own [stamps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp "Postage stamp"), for which he received a prison sentence in court. Only a pardon by the Austrian [President](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Austria "President of Austria") saved him from going to jail.

> As Kugelmugel came to be quite well-known in the public, it also became a tourist attraction of Vienna.
