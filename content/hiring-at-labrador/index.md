I’ve started at [Labrador](https://www.thelabrador.co.uk/) about a month ago and now it’s time to hire our core engineering team.

We do have some pretty interesting challenges from scalability to big data (a single user means to us at least 1GB of data per month).

Still, I am struggling to find the right people to join us.

I’ve engaged with 3 good recruitment firms in London and I know it’s a tough market and I didn’t expect to see a queue of people lined up at the door but I struggle to understand why it’s being so hard.

For being a startup I think we pay well, we are well funded, we work with hot stuff (like IOT, Big Data, Smart Energy, Serverless tech on AWS), we want to embrace all the good practises (continuous delivery and deployment, infrastructure as code, automated tests, fail fast, lean startup) and we offer EMI options to what is going to be the core engineering team.

Joining Labrador now means shaping its technology and learning loads, on a hourly basis.

We’ve got a good fancy office, since we funded by [Hambro Perks](http://www.hambroperks.com/), free (really good) coffee, crazy fast internet, areo chair, latest macs, 27" 4k screens.

Our codebase right now is mostly node.js (AWS Lambdas) and we started writing some other lambdas in Java8. We are flexible on the programming language, as soon as it runs on a Lambda we are happy to experiment (especially with JVM based languages, Groovy, Scala, Clojure, Kotlin, you name it). Oh we already have some Python scripts and we are keen doing more Python.

So where are gone all the good engineers in London?

_Please note that if you are a recruiter and we didn’t sign a contract with you I will ban you for life if you contact me or if you send me profiles, etc._
