[This year](http://www.agileday.it/front/2009/italian-agile-day-2009/) I’ve decided to propose an "_experimental_" session: a wall will be available during the conference and the attendees will be asked to put their questions/puzzles about agile, with a special focus on real life projects.

The wall will be handled like a retrospective one, clustering common subjects and people will be asked to vote, then I’ll choose the most interesting and I’ll talk about it .

This will give me a chance to understand how and where agile software development is going in Italy and it will be quite a challenge: I won’t bring my Mac, I won’t prepare anything, pure improvisation!

Surely I’ll blog about it right after, and hopefully I’ll find some time & energies answering to some of the unanswered questions on the blog.
