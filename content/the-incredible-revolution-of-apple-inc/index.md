The iPhone is not only just a new product, it’s a revolution like Steve Jobs said on his [presentation](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/), it’s the phone reinvented and it’s incredible.

In addition to this it was incredible to see the guests on the presentation: the CEO of Google, Yahoo! and Cingular all these company together… For this new device working with Apple…
