This is the third post of 3 on walking away from social media, inspired by [this article](https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/).

I’ve been using less and less Twitter, and I’ve decided it’s not worth using it anymore.

Of all of the 3 Social Media that I’ve decided to cut off with, Twitter was the ‘most friendly’ for deletion.

I’ve used [TweetDelete](https://www.tweetdelete.net/) for this, what the app made me realise is that tweets are highly ephemeral, a tweet that is older than a month is basically pointless, the linked data will be crawlable and searchable, so basically your old tweets are just food for marketing, advertising, data crunchers, machine learning.

I am not 100% if I’ll stay off from it, and I am keeping my lovely username which has only six letters, the fact that deleting is actually quite doable makes me trust a little bit more this platform.

However, if I’ll ever be back I might use tweet delete to keep the timeline short, deleting old tweets.

As a computer engineer I also find amusing that Twitter caches so badly the tweets counts, they are a bit better at counting likes (smaller numbers), but I have no likes or tweets.

There seems to be a bug also on my home page, I’ve unfollowed everyone but Twitter still thinks I am following a couple of users.
