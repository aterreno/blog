One of the biggest strength of Agile software development is the capability of mixing up many different tools and techniques. Agile is not a check- box list of practices that you have to embrace in your project. With [this experience report](http://db.tt/XsgLyEGe) I want to share the experience of a continuous, repeatable successful project: the agile cocktail we created worked perfectly for us. This is not necessarily saying it will be perfect for you. However, on any future project I will always begin with this mix, inspecting and adapting it afterwards, only changing if necessary.
