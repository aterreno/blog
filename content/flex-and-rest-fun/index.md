I’ve played a little with Flex in these last days, I’ve built up a Cover Flow Style Application to browse your Facebook friends.

It uses [Facebook AS3](http://code.google.com/p/facebook-as3/) REST API and the [SebCoverFlow](http://www.sebastiaanholtrop.com/sebcoverflowprojectpage) library for the Cover Flow.

It’s [online here](http://fflow.the-arm.com/), and the source code is [here](http://code.google.com/p/fflow/). I don’t know if I’ll spend more time on it but however, Flex & REST seems really the way to go.
