The Green Java Black is now free on [JBB](http://www.javablackbelt.com/), no more need to post questions in order to get the points necessary to have the exam, definitely a good achievement of the community.

> Get your green belt for free

> It’s been 4 years now since JBB started and we are proud of what the community has achieved:

> There are 55 released exams (84 counting beta exams), for a total of 31,210 available questions. Our 39,274 users have taken a combined 240,396 exams during which they gave 2,684,770 answers, 53% of which were correct!

> Now that we have so much material ready to challenge you, we’ve decided to make more of it free. Currently, only the two exams needed to get the yellow belt are free. From now on, if you follow a given path, you can take up to 9 exams without any contribution.

> The pros and cons have been discussed in the following forum thread, feel free to have a look.

> The next features we are going to focus on are the tools that help moderators do their work. A first step will be to unify question listings, and as usual we’ve started a thread to welcome all your suggestions.
