Tomorrow will be my last day in Vienna.

I’ve loved this city, I spent here six nice months. I’ll end this adventure with the concert of Pearl Jam, a perfect end no?

I would like to thanks the [Italians on line](http://www.italiansonline.net/sezioni_indirizzi.php?sezione=27), I met nice people there and the page with the addresses is really useful. Yesterday I got my last austrian pizza at [I Ragazzi,](http://blog.java2me.org/http//:www.iragazzi.at) difficult to find a pizza good like this even in Italy!
