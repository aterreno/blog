1.  [Spring Java Configuration](http://www.springsource.org/javaconfig) is the answer of Rod Johnson to all xml haters, with javaconfig you can configure the whole Spring IOC in pure Java
2.  [Spring Autowiring with Annotations](http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/beans.html#beans-autowired-annotation) will lead you to a more readable and smaller xml configuration file
3.  [Spring Transactions with Annotations](http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/transaction.html) will let you fine-grained configuration of your service layer transactionality
4.  [Spring and Terracotta](http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/devdocs/Terracotta+for+Spring+Architecture) play together very well, if you’re worried about HA/Clustering have a go
5.  [Spring and REST](http://blog.springsource.com/2009/03/08/rest-in-spring-3-mvc/): the version 3 of Spring will let you write RESTful service with just a couple of annotations
6.  [Spring Testability](http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/testing.html#testcontext-ctx-management) is unbeaten: there’s nothing as easy to test as a POJO, in addition to that Spring offers autowiring and transaction managment inside the tests
7.  [Spring OSGi](http://www.springsource.org/osgi): assuming that OSGi is a good idea Spring is already there
8.  [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/) is not a silver bullet but you’ll have to point me a gun in order to consider EJB3 as an alternative
