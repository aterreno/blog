After two+ smashing years I took the decision to leave [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/), I’ve produced 16,766 kg of CO2 (at least that’s what [dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/aterreno/carbon) says…) and I decided that it was the right moment to settle down a bit and give up with my gypsy life.

I’m joining [Erudine](http://www.erudine.com/), a medium-small company located in [Harrogate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrogate), I’ll work on their product, a behaviour engine (a very flexible knowledge acquisition application that uses [ripple down rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_down_rules)… I Still have to properly figure out what the heck is that but it sounds cool no?)

Leaving drinks at the White Hart in London, 21st of this month.
