Finally, I’ve done it, I am the elite of social media, [after deleting all my content about a month](https://medium.com/@javame/walking-off-from-facebook-b4e7d4a6da97) ago I’ve now deleted my account.  
   
**What did I learn in my facebook-less month?**

Weird things happened: I did notice a lot of flickering on the screen and suspicious web traffic. I can only assume that content is deleted from the ‘wall’ but it’s still on Facebook.   
I can also assume that content is replicated across so many different data stores that once you post something it’s owned by Facebook, leave any hope behind! You can’t really delete anything from Facebook.   
I’ve found myself "addicted" to visit Facebook at least once a day, to check for notifications or messages: I use inbox zero for my email, and my brain works that way for facebook too, "notifications zero" or no red flags in the otherwise "peaceful" blue interface.   
It’s a bit scary, you don’t need Facebook in life and those notifications are pretty much useless.   
Given that my wall was empty I started seeing once a day all of that useless (sorry friends!) content and I ended up installing [News Feed Eradicator for Facebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg): a great little extension for Chrome which replaces the Facebook wall with a "motivational quote", after some days looking at those quotes (more interesting than most of the content that I’ve seen on Facebook in the last 10~ years!) it was obvious that the only clever thing to do with Facebook was to close the account down.   
Facebook gave me nothing in almost 10 years, nothing at all, it only took my privacy away.   
I became friend with people I didn’t talk with for 20 years and I ended up having weird conversations with people that I see at max once a year because they knew what I was up to.

On a less personal scale, Facebook helped to decide (for the worse) an Election (USA) and a Referendum (Brexit) and it’s [proven to be bad for your mental health](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/15/facebook-mental-health-psychology-social-media): walk away from it, not only you are wasting your precious life you are also doing something bad for yourself and for the world.
