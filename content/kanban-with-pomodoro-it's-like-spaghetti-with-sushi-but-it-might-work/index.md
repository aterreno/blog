I’ve read a couple of tweets today (demonstrating that Twitter perhaps sometimes makes sense) and I’m aggregating them here:

[Jason Yip](http://twitter.com/jchyip) twitted a link to [this short, clever blog post](http://blog.mattwynne.net/2009/05/27/kanban-state-of-mind/) from [Matt Wynne](http://blog.mattwynne.net/) defining kanban:

-   **There are no iterations**: only now. Work at a pace you can truly sustain.
-   **Done means** it is in the user’s hands. Nothing less.
-   **Limit the Work in Progress**. This forces you to get things _done_, or you’ll have nothing else to do.
-   **Get better all the time**. Keep tuning your process and tools to fit the way you need to work today — make [kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) a culture, not an event. Everyone is responsible.
-   **Decide with data**. Collect the data you need in time to make [responsible decisions](http://www.infoq.com/articles/real-options-enhance-agility).

What scares me is the lack of iterations in the Kanban system, how can you keep the focus high on the team?

Just few minutes earlier [Henrikk Niberg](http://twitter.com/henrikkniberg) was twitting:

> Ouch, Kanban + Pomodoro hurts. Tells you exactly how inefficient and behind schedule you are, and why. Pain leads to learning…

What’s scares me about the [pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) is the too fined grained knowledge of what’s going on, with the big risk of introducing waste in the process… And its rigidity…

It seems that a lot of people around the world are now using those two techniques, anybody has some real experience of using them together in a project?
