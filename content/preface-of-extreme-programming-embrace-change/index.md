To some folks, XP seems like just good common sense. So why the "extreme" in the name? XP   
takes commonsense principles and practices to extreme levels.   
â —  If code reviews are good, we’ll review code all the time (pair programming).   
â —  If testing is good, everybody will test all the time (unit testing), even the customers   
(functional testing).   
â —  If design is good, we’ll make it part of everybody’s daily business (refactoring).   
â —  If simplicity is good, we’ll always leave the system with the simplest design that supports its   
current functionality (the simplest thing that could possibly work).   
â —  If architecture is important, everybody will work defining and refining the architecture all the   
time (metaphor).   
â —  If integration testing is important, then we’ll integrate and test several times a day   
(continuous integration).   
â —  If short iterations are good, we’ll make the iterations really, really shortâ€"seconds and   
minutes and hours, not weeks and months and years (the Planning Game).
