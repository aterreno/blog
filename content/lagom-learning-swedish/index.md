No, even if I’ll live for more or less 6 months in Sweden I don’t think that I’ll learn the language, is quite interesting, a mixture of English and German, in my ignorant humble opinion, of course, but also a bit difficult :-).

By the way I found a very nice word to define something that needs a phrase in English (or in Italian).

> The [Lexin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexin "Lexin") Swedish-English dictionary defines lagom as "enough, sufficient, adequate, just right." Lagom is also widely translated as "**in moderation**," "**in balance**," "**optimal**," "**suitable**," and "average." But whereas words like "sufficient" and "average" suggest some degree of abstinence, scarcity, or failure, lagom carries the connotation of **perfection** or **appropriateness**. The archetypical Swedish proverb "**Lagom Ã¤r bÃ¤st**," literally "Lagom is best," is translated as "Enough is as good as a feast" in the Lexin dictionary. That same proverb is translated as "There is virtue in moderation" in Prismas Stora Engelska Ordbok (1995).

from [Lagom — Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom#Other_languages)

Isn’t a perfect word to define how the application of a methodology (Agile/XP/Scrum) on a project should be?
