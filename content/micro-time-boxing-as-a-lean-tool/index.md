I’ve started a month ago to draft a Mind Map about Time Boxing particularly related to Lean concepts with [Staffan Nöteberg](http://rekursiv.se/) using [Mind Meister](https://www.mindmeister.com/), it has been fun, a sort of remote ping pong pair programming, pair thinking actually.

Now I’m very busy and far from Europe (I’m a trainer in the current ThoughtWorks University batch in India) and it’s getting more diffucult to follow this “_project_”.

I decided then to make this mind map public, putting the source online, any contribution, comment and question will be very much appreciated.
