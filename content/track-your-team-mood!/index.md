Team mood is very important, it’s an indicator on how the project is going, a good mood is essential to exit from bad situations, a bad mood should be fixed as soon as possible.

I never tracked the mood in a team (I think I’ll in the future) and I reckon a graph like this:

Grab it from [the Agile Vital Signs Dashboard file](http://allaboutagile.googlegroups.com/web/Agile+Project+Vital+Signs+Dashboard.xls?gda=KbXkh1kAAADo41Ulc7Royl80p6UJhQFrg42LGeNd8dc0zzDNy1q-h7CJyXzpUhPz40fLOOy_dq61ziBndP56qwtLnsraiVaBrq5TRf4YzmhvvxiQXIDvkIQIqBBuatoZ3GVm6VpieyE&gsc=1naLVQsAAABwo0c13zfs8viLt9xl0_IG), from the good blog [all about agile](http://agile-software-development.com/).

The end of spring/iteration retrospective could be the ideal moment to record the team mood.

What’s behind a good mood? Let’s try to make it happen on the next iteration!  
What’s behind a bad mood? Let’s try to fix it creating some actions.
