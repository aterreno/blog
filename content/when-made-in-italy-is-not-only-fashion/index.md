[Francesco](http://cirillosscrapbook.wordpress.com) just published his brand [new website](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) about the pomodoro technique and [Staffan](http://rekursiv.se/) just published the first draft on the technique of [his book.](http://www.pomodoro-book.com/)

As an additional coincidence [Renzo](http://www.reborg.net/) [talked](http://reborg.net/talks/20090209_Tomatoes_Software_Craftsmanship%20Group.pdf) about it at the Software [Craftsmanship Meeting](http://groups.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

All around the world from Sweden to the US it’s all about italian tomatoes!

> _The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any kind of task._ For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by ‘the ticking clock’, especially when a deadline is involved, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.

> The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to continually improve the way we work or study.
