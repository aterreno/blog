After reading a lot of discussion everywhere, mailing lists, blogs and so on, after seeing the full presentation of Steve Jobs, after the first big incredible enthusiasm I would like to write down some points just to read it then, in six, twelve months.

1.  Is important to install applications?  
    Well, yes. It is, but, is Java necessary inside the iPhone? Maybe not. Maybe some nice widget and a good browser web is all what you need here. Read my post [My current point of view on J2ME](http://blog.java2me.org/2007/01/14/my-current-point-of-view-on-j2me/ "Permanent Link to My current point of view on J2ME") if you’re still sure that there’s space for J2ME on the mobile phones. I read also this post about [Java and Phones](http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2007/01/in-which-i-think-about-java-again-but-only-for-a-moment/) in one comment one guy says: _“J2ME is the best available open mobile platform but thatâ€™s only because itâ€™s the ONLY open mobile platform.”_
2.  Does will have a success?  
    Maybe yes maybe not, I’m not Hudini. The Apple profits are high like never before, they stock actions are going well and some Mac fanatics (like me maybe) will buy it.
3.  Will I buy it?  
    Maybe yes maybe not. For sure as soon as It will be available on a Mac Store I’ll jump there and I have no doubt, a lot of people will do it.
4.  Wasn’t a great moment for the computer history?  
    In my humble opinion yes. The presentation of Jobs was great and he was breaking a lot of rules. So it was a great moment.
5.  The revolution is a revolution?  
    A man alone against the world cannot do a revolution itself, the history is full of good products having no success on the market or crap products having a lot of success (Windows 95?) so it will depends a lot on the people buying it and finding it very usable as it seems.
6.  Is the phone reinvented?  
    Yes it is, there’s no keyboard, maybe there will be no Java, still to understand if the browser is good or not but is different.
7.  What about the competitors?  
    They will react on this somehow. Nokia is producing no more such good phones as in the past, too many models with not such a great UI. I sow an [LG designed in collaboration with Prada](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/first-pictures-of-the-lg-prada-phone-222990.php), it’s without the keyboard as well…

Everything in progress… Looking forward to June, on how the US market will react on the iPhone.  
I’m sure of one thing: nothing will be like before, even if the direction of Jobs is wrong.
