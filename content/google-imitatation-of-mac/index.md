Google is following the same way of the first microsoft, it’s putting a lot of stuff on the windows machines that’s already on the mac os since ages.

I’m talking about the gadgets, take a look here: [http://desktop.google.com/plugins/](http://desktop.google.com/plugins/) or on the fast search (if you have google desktop 4, try to press 2 times the CTRL key…)

I mean, it’s the same stuff, it’s cool but takes tons of memory.

Also the crawler, it’s nothing more than the finder :-) Isn’t amazing?

By the way I really like the google spreedsheet, [http://](http://spreadsheets.google.com/)spreadsheets.**google**.com/   
With jmdf now we have a shared spreedsheet of our mobile phones, isn’t cool? [credits to edschepis]

Another "web 2.0" cool thing that I’ve tried is the integration with web services beetween flickr and this WP blog… Was really easy the cooperation, was easy to setup (cos no setup!) …

This is the direction, more easy for everyone, more mac style in the end… ;-)
