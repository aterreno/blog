In the team we are used to be Agile, and especially what I call being Agile doing Agile stuff. Which means being not dogmatic: stop doing a practice when it does not give us enough value and starting it again when we feel that we are missing it. Not only: we also try always to introduce something new.

Since the beginning of the project we had 2 swim lanes on the wall, one for actionsÂ to do and one for actions done, we just added a third column, the keep doing actions, it’s like having [a star fish](http://www.thekua.com/rant/?p=370) always there.

The waste bin. Yeah, we are interested in what’s going on with lean, so now there’s a box on the wall, if someone in the team feels that is wasting (s)he can put a card there, we’ll discuss it during the retrospective.

As a reminder, the seven [lean](http://www.poppendieck.com/papers/LeanThinking.pdf) waste types:

1.  Overproduction = Extra Features
2.  Inventory = Requirements
3.  Extra Processing Steps = Extra Steps
4.  Motion = Finding Information
5.  Defects = Defects Not Caught by Tests
6.  Waiting = Waiting, Including Customers
7.  Transportation = Handoffs
