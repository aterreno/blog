> WWDC 2007, SAN FRANCISCOâ€”June 11, 2007â€”AppleÂ® today announced that its revolutionary iPhoneâ„¢ will run applications created with Web 2.0 Internet standards when it begins shipping on June 29. Developers can create Web 2.0 applications which look and behave just like the applications built into iPhone, and which can seamlessly access iPhoneâ€™s services, including making a phone call, sending an email and displaying a location in Google Maps. Third-party applications created using Web 2.0 standards can extend iPhoneâ€™s capabilities without compromising its reliability or security.
