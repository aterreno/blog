I didn’t knew of Evo before, I just bumped into it reading some stuff about post-agile project management…

It’s not so far from the agile I know (at least the agile I used so far)

> Evo Principles SUMMARY:   
> 1\. Real results, of value to real stakeholders, will be delivered early and frequently.

> 2\. The next Evo delivery step must be the one that delivers the most stakeholder value   
> possible at that time.

> 3\. Evo steps deliver the specified requirements, evolutionarily.

> 4\. We cannot know all the right requirements in advance, but we can discover them more   
> quickly by attempts to deliver real value to real stakeholders.

> 5\. Evo is holistic systems engineering — all necessary aspects of the system must be   
> complete and correct — and delivered to a real stakeholder environment — it is not only   
> about programming — it is about customer satisfaction.

> 6\. Evo projects will require an open architecture — because we are going to change   
> project ideas as often as we need to, in order to really deliver value to our stakeholders.

> 7\. The Evo project team will focus their energy, as a team, towards success in the current   
> Evo step. They will succeed or fail in the current step, together. They will not waste   
> energy on downstream steps until they have mastered current steps successfully

> 8\. Evo is about learning from hard experience, as fast as we can — what really works, and   
> what really delivers value. Evo is a discipline to make us confront our problems early —   
> but which allows us to progress quickly when we really provably have got it right.

> 9\. Evo leads to early, and on-time, product delivery — both because of selected early   
> priority delivery, and because we learn to get things right early.

> 10\. Evo should allow us to prove out new work processes, and get rid of bad ones early.

Full doc, with description of every single point [here](http://www.xs4all.nl/~nrm/EvoPrinc/EvoPrinciples.pdf)

Worth having a look to the [website](http://www.gilb.com/) of the creators of the document above.

The only thing (marketing probably) I don’t really like is the sentence "Evo makes project failure structurally impossible!"

That’s structurally impossible!  
Evo fails, Agile fails… Just slightly less than Waterfall!
