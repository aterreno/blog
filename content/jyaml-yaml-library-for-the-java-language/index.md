> JYaml is a Java library for working with the Yaml file format.

> What is Yaml?

> Yaml is a data serialization language that is well suited for structured data and yet simpler and more human-readable than XML. It is perfect for configuration files, initialization files, and other application specific files.  
> Direct mapping to programming objects with JYaml
