During [ThoughtWorks University XI](http://cipher-quaker.blogspot.com/2008/11/final-thoughtworks-university-for-2009.html) we took the decision to introduce to the trainees [Waffle](http://waffle.codehaus.org/) as an example of [MVC framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller).

I’ve been impressed by the simplicity of the framework. It has been a while since the last time I’ve played with any Java Web Framework ( I think it was around 6 years ago the last time, using the super hated Struts 1.0! )

So the first good news is the Java world is alive and some good people are writing great frameworks ( with also the big help of all the knowledge/experience gained using other languages)

I’ve a very personal opinion on this: many people moved to Ruby and have such a bad remembering of the old times in Java, well I think that frameworks like Waffle keeps the name of Java high.

In addition to that Waffle has a nicer design compared to Rails, no command line scripting ( you might like it, I don’t ), it’s not annotation heavy and you don’t have to write a line of xml ( ok, just one but in the web.xml! )

The only bad thing of Waffle is that there’s not that much documentation on the web ( I’ve to say that it’s so simple to use that you don’t need it! ) so my goal for the next months will be blog as much as possible about it and prepare some speeches too.

When I find something good I definitely want to spread it, and this is the case.

> Waffle is different from the multitude of web frameworks that exist today, in that Waffle:

-   has no mandatory XML configuration files (beyond a minimalist web.xml required by any J2EE-compliant webapp)
-   is interoperable with best-of-breed UI templating technologies
-   does not have a base controller class to extend or interface to implement
-   has controller classes that can support multiple actions, each a single method rather than a sequence of initialiation/settter/execute methods
-   has a small learning curve
