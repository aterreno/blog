I wrote a small, very very simple MIDlet for time boxing since more than one person mentioned in last weeks that it would be nice to use such an application.

It’s a MIDP 2.0 app and it should work on any phone, on my N95 works fine. Depending on the number of downloads and feedbacks maybe I’ll improve it. (UI is poor, no customization possible for instance…)
