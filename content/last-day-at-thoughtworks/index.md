Today is my last day at ThoughtWorks, it has been an intense, challenging year.

Monday I will start a new adventure at [Forward](http://www.forward.co.uk/), I am excited about this as much as I was to join ThoughtWorks the first time in 2006.

I will work with some very talented former colleagues and friends like [Mike](http://michaeljon.es/) & [Pingles](http://oobaloo.co.uk/) and many others great guys, in a very agile/lean company, I will finally learn Ruby & Clojure and practise continuous deployment…

There’s enough good stuff to keep me busy and happy for a while!
