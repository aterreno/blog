I’ve been suffering of selenese flu for months, being on a .net project we were using selenium RC. The typical symptoms are flaky, slow tests and sometimes a lot of sleeps in your code to make it work.

Selenium has its age and it struggles to cope with the current web 2.0 asynchronous calls & rich javascript.

Fortunately old good [Simon](http://www.pubbitch.org/blog/) is working hard at Google on [webdriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/), and in December the official port has been released also [for the .net platform](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list).

It works alright, there are some classes missing and you have to put the IE dll on your project as a content so that it gets copied on the bin folder to make it work.

A part from that, it’s faster, more reliable, more fun to write.

It’s time to cure your flu, webdriver is your medication.
