Well we all agree that code should be readable, but what on websites? Most of the times the font is too small, there are banners around, weird colour combinations, today by coincidence I found [this awesome application](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/).

> READABILITY is a simple tool that makes reading on the Web more enjoyable by removing the clutter around what you’re reading.

It works very well, reading a nice article is just like reading a page of a book.
