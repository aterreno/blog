It’s almost two months now that I use Maven every day, I have to say that it helped me a lot, I’m much more productive.

There are, indeed things that I don’t like and problems but the dependency management is really sweet, the project setup too, with the archetypes.

Some good links to start if you’re still not mavenized:

-   [Web applications with maven](http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/03/01/building-web-applications-with-maven-2.html)
-   [Jar Search Engine](http://findjar.com/) to find unresolved dependencies
-   [Maven Browser](http://www.mvnbrowser.com/index.html) to browse Maven repositories
-   [M2 for Eclipse](http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/) to integrate Maven with Eclipse

I still get annoyed sometimes, with the xml, with some weird repositories publishing strange versions, or just with [Log4J](http://onemanwenttomow.wordpress.com/2007/12/31/maven2-log4j-and-jmx-dependencies/) for example, depending on libraries not available on any repository, but hey, Maven downloaded for me, only once, only in one place hundreds of jar, I’ll really never do that job again by myself.
