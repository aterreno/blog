I had some downloads and some feedbacks, so why not spending another couple of "boxes" and write some more code?

-   In this "release" there’s a simple sound (next step will be to have something like a rooster/alarm clock, that would be great)
-   There’s a countdown with the minutes, seconds remaining for the current task (work or break)
-   Screen is still fullsize, someone told me that he doesn’t know what to do with it when it starts, perhaps I’ll add in the future a customized menu with some graphic button at the bottom of the screen

The code, if you wanna have a look is on Google code [here](http://code.google.com/p/mobileboxing/), the current MIDlet is [here](http://blog.java2me.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/mobileboxing.zip).
