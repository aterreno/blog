As a user I want to fully delete my account from [eventful](http://eventful.com/) so that I’m sure my details are safe

Unfortunately there’s no delete account functionality in eventful, in the [FAQ](http://eventful.com/faq#acct-cancel) they explain:

> How do I cancel/delete my account?  
> Unfortunately, **we don’t have the functionality in place to delete or cancel accounts**. You can unsubscribe from any emails you’re receiving, however.

> Currently, the best solution to this problem is to do the following yourself:

-   Log in to Eventful.com and click on your username (upper right corner). This brings you to your profile page.
-   Click on every event, performer, venue, group and calendar which you have created, joined, favorited, friended, or commented on.
-   Delete comments, withdraw demands, events, performers, calendars, leave groups, and unfriend users.
-   Go to your user’s preferences and change your email address to something unrecognizable
-   Delete any saved locations inside your preferences as well.
-   Remove any description or interests from your public profile section in the user’s preferences.

> This lengthy process effectively removes any activity you’ve done throughout our system. There is still a small chance you may show up in certain situations, and your profile will still be accessable and visible.

> If you would like, you can then re-join under a different username. ([back to top](http://eventful.com/faq#top))

That’s terrible!

We always say that is the customer that has to prioritize the stories to implement, this story is clearly important but from a user point of view, never underestimate this!
