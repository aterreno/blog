Ah! That was just a catchy title, Hey hey, my my, Agile can never die!

But [somebody](http://www.noop.nl/2009/02/the-decline-and-fall-of-agilists.html) thinks that agilists are falling, declining…

I think agile is evolving, changing, have a look to the just newly created Software Craftsmanship manifesto [here](http://groups.google.com/group/software_craftsmanship/web/the-new-left-side) or the the New Left Side as the [groups](http://groups.google.com/group/software_craftsmanship) also calls it. It’s quite an evolution from the well known [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)…

> As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional  
> software development by practicing it and helping others learn the  
> craft. Through this work we have come to value:

> well-crafted software over working software over comprehensive documentation  
> steadily adding value over responding to change over following a plan  
> a community of professionals over individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> impressing our customer over customer collaboration over contract negotiation

> That is, while we still value the items in the middle over the items on  
> the right, we value the items on the left even more.
