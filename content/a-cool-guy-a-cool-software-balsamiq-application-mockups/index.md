Thanks to [Alberto](http://www.linkedin.com/in/alagna) that forwarded me this [blog post](http://www.funambol.com/blog/capo/2008/11/italian-software-story.html) about the creator of this nice piece of software:

> The story is about Giacomo ‘Peldi’ Guilizzoni, a former Senior Software Engineering Lead at Adobe in San Francisco, who moved back to Italy and started a company called [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/company).

> His company is actually a “Micro-ISV” or a single-employee company. That is, a guy in a studio. A guy who wrote a product called “[Balsamiq Mockups](http://www.balsamiq.com/)” which allows anyone to build a mockup of a GUI: the genius is that the mockup resembles one you would scribble on a piece of paper, rather than a computer one. It sells online for $79.

> To make the story short, the product is fantastic and he grossed over $100k in five months. And the business is growing fast.

> Why do I know? Because [he made it all public](http://www.balsamiq.com/blog) in his blog. He promised he would do it. And you have all the measures of his business (and how much he is donating to non-profits).
