I’ve been involved in quite some agile consulting gigs in my work life.

There’s one lesson I want to share: if you want to change an organisation you have to change their company culture first.

If you are trying to employ a consultancy firm try to get ready your people to start with, avoid wasting money making sure that your employees are ready to embrace the change.

Make sure that you communicated well and straight that things are gonna change now.

If you are a consultant, make sure that you will have enough slack on the project to work on the company culture, plan, discuss with the client when and how that work will be performed.

Otherwise change won’t work: people will work in micro waterfall iterations, they will use continuous feedbacks to drive others people carriers, they will still micro manage their teams, they will eventually fail and all their effort to "change" and your effort to make them "a better" place to work for will vanish without evident benefits.
