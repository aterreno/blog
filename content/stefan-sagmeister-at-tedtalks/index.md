[Stefan Sagmeister at TEDTalks: “Yes, design can make you happy” — (37signals)](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/507-stefan-sagmeister-at-tedtalks-yes-design-can-make-you-happy)  
A list from designer Stefan Sagmeisterâ€™s diary:

Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.  
Thinking life will be better in the future is stupid. I have to live now.  
Being not truthful works against me.  
Helping other people helps me.  
Organizing a charity group is surprisingly easy.  
Everything I do always comes back to me.  
Drugs feel great in the beginning and become a drag later on.  
Over time I get used to everything and start taking it for granted.  
Money does not make me happy.  
Traveling alone is helpful for a new perspective on life.  
Assuming is stifling.  
Keeping a diary supports my personal development.  
Trying to look good limits my life.  
Worrying solves nothing.  
Material luxuries are best enjoyed in small doses.  
Having guts always works out for me.
