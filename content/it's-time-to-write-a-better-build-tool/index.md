That’s what I’ve heard more than one time in the last months, half of my friends complain about maven, the other half is just _almost_ happy with ant. The rubists are _generally_ happy with rake, the biggest problems are on the java/.net world.

So I thought about branching ant and rewriting it in a slightly different way, using yaml instead of xml and having always only one option for any task parameter. I always hated and found difficult to remember how to do things in ant since there are always two or more good alternatives (like why there’s a dir and a file parameter option in the delete command? Isn’t a directory a file?).

So, I don’t think I’ll be able to allocate a lot of time to this, but I would love to hear something from you, ideas and comments.

In the last weeks I’ve started to write a shared mind map with [Staffan Nöteberg](http://rekursiv.se/) on micro time boxing… Maybe we can do the same with this topic.

Ping me if you’re interested.
