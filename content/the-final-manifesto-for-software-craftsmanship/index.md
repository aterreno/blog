The guys of the Craftsmanship group finally released a final version of their manifesto, have a look [here](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)!

> As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

> Not only working software,

> but also well-crafted software

> Not only responding to change,

> but also steadily adding value

> Not only individuals and interactions,

> but also a community of professionals

> Not only customer collaboration,

> but also productive partnerships

> That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

> Â© 2009, the undersigned.  
> this statement may be freely copied in any form,  
> but only in its entirety through this notice.
