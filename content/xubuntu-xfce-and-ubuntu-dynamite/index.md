Since I’ve (and I had also at JC06) some problems with my Bluetooth Server I’ve reinstalled Linux on my Laptop, this time I’ve tried xubuntu, looks not bad. Looks really fast and there’s just what I need, nothing more.

In less than 1 hour I have my jdk, eclipse, the bluez libraries, 2 bluetooth dongles and it works :-)

I like it a lot, the interfaces are really simple and easy to use, [thunar](http://thunar.xfce.org/wiki/), the file manger it’s great in my opinion, looks like the mac finder :-)  
[Xubuntu — Xfce and Ubuntu Dynamite](http://www.xubuntu.com/)  
Xubuntu is a complete GNU/Linux based system with an Ubuntu base. It’s lighter, and more efficient than Ubuntu with GNOME or KDE, since it uses the Xfce Desktop environment, which makes it ideal for old or low-end machines, as well as thin-client networks.

Old machines? My asus m6n isn’t old, I just don’t wanna waste memory with stupid unuseful and confusing interfaces!!!
