Two nice websites discovered today (thanks to the flu probably): [Jim Nilsson](http://www.jnsk.se/weblog/)Â weblog and from here I found [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/) and then this book:

> [InfoQ: InfoQ Book: Domain Driven Design Quickly](http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/12/domain-driven-design)  
> Despite the importance of Domain Driven Design, not many people are aware of it, which is why InfoQ commissioned the writing of a 100 page mini-book: Domain Driven Design Quickly, and like all InfoQ books is available for free download as well as print-purchase. The book is a short, quickly-readable summary and introduction to the fundamentals of DDD; it does not introduce any new concepts; it attempts to concisely summarize the essence of what DDD is, drawing mostly Eric Evans’ 576 page book, as well other sources since published such as Jimmy Nilsson’s Applying Domain Driven Design, and various DDD discussion forums. Main topics in the book include:

-   Building Domain Knowledge
-   The Ubiquitous Language
-   Model Driven Design
-   Refactoring Toward Deeper Insight
-   Preserving Model Integrity
