I’m just having a look to Fan and it seems quite a cool language, soon more posts on this.

[Fan Programming Language](http://www.fandev.org/): “Portability  
Write code portable to both the Java VM and the .NET CLR.

**Familiar Syntax**  
Java and C# programmers will feel at home with Fan’s curly brace syntax.

**Concurrency**  
Tackle concurrency with built-in immutability, message passing, and REST oriented transactional memory.

**Static and Dynamic Typing**  
Don’t like the extremes — take the middle of the road.

**Elegant APIs**  
We’re quite obsessive about providing all the key features required for a standard library, but with much less surface area than the APIs found in Java or .NET.

**Object Oriented**  
Everything is an object.

**Mixins**  
Interfaces but with implementation.

**Functional**  
Functions and closures are baked in.

**Serialization**  
Built-in ‘JSON like’ serialization syntax makes Fan ideal for declarative programming too.

**REST**  
Model data with a unified namespace of resources identified with URIs.
