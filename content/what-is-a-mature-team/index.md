On the [italian XP mailing list](http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming-it/), [Tommaso Torti](http://lordtom.blogspot.com/) asked an interesting question to the list few days ago.

When do you define a team ‘mature’?

Translating myself, my reply was something like:

> A mature team is a team that implements at its best the theories written on books, that makes concrete what’s on paper in value for the client.   
> It’s cohesion and communication.   
> A team that’s mature is a team that hasn’t nothing to do anymore, it’s mature, can still improve?   
> In my very personal opinion it’s a death team, the mission is achieved, it’s time to change, it’s time to shuffle the cards. Roll in new people, change.

Some other interesting replies to the question:

A mature team is a team robust to change, wich means that it’s able to change without crumbling the process.

A mature team is a team that doesn’t need a manager, a project leader, an architect or a designer in order to produce results. It’s able in an autonomous way to increase its own productivity.

[Luca Minuduel](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/luka/Default.aspx) quotes from the [website](http://www.cateams.com/index.php?id=39) of Joseph Pelrine:

\* Flexible and responsive to changing organisational conditions and wider environments.  
  
 \* Able to work with pressure, uncertainty and disagreement.  
  
 \* Able to be self-organising and self-regulating.  
  
 \* Maximise the strengths and creativity of each team member.  
  
 \* Satisfies both organisational and individual needs

and [Marco](http://www.mythodology.com/self-organisation):

AEntre más [reglas poker](http://www.arc-ag.com/como-jugar-reglas-poker.html) compares mejor. system in equilibrium naturally tends to resist to change and that’s why we need to apply a force (questions/retrospectives/etc for people, splitting for stories, refactoring for code), because we need to take the system at the edge of chaos to facilitate the emergence of a new, spontaneous configuration.

Definitely a nice conversation, and for you what’s a mature team?
