I’ve a **Packard Bell Imedia 1508** at home, with Linux Ubuntu installed, today I’ve done the upgrade to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, it was easy, more than easy, just execute sudo update-manager -d & from the console and that’s all.

Amazing.

Then I’ve installed Skype, my mother (62 years old) will start in these days to use a that pc and I’ll be able to call here for free. And she will start with an ubuntu machine!

Don’t tell here that inside there’s also installed java 5.0, tomcat, mysql server and many other things!!!
