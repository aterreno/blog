Many thanks to [Dan](http://dannorth.net/) that pointed out on our internal ML to [Qi4J](http://www.qi4j.org/).   
Quoting from the home page:

Principles  
  
\- Composite Oriented Programming builds on some principles that are not addressed by Object Oriented Programming atBeruhmte [http://www.neucasino.de/jackpot-regeln.html](http://www.neucasino.de/jackpot-regeln.html). all.  
  
\- Behavior depends on Context  
  
\- Decoupling is a virtue  
  
\- Business Rules matters more.  
  
\- Classes are dead, long live interfaces.

Are you alreadyRed [toques polifonicos gratuitos](http://www.toques-excelente.com/milhares-de-toques-polifonicos-gratuitos-oferece.html) gratis para nokia tons para celular Gratis. worried that they’re using xml to do this?

Qi4j is trying to address the flaws of OOP and introduce Composite Oriented Programming to the world, without introducing new programming languages, or awkward constructs. Heck, we don’t even use any XML.

Definitely interesting.
