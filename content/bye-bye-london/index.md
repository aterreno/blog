Well, with a flight and an hotel booking in my bag I think it’s enough official, I’m moving to China, Hong Kong more precisely (there’s Beijing planned in 3 months but that’s another story).

Playing for a while again (after a good year spent with (alt).Net) with old good Java Code and financial sfuff like Fix, Securities and Fidessa. I’ve the feeling that’s gonna be fun and I’ll meet few fellow Twers there aka [AgileHongKong](http://agilehongkong.com/) Crowd :-)

Going East has been an objective in my life since I’ve read a [Fortune Teller Told me](http://www.amazon.com/Fortune-Teller-Told-Me-Earthbound-Travels/dp/060980958X), will I ever come back to Europe? We’ll see. :-)
