Very nice stuff [Yan Cui](https://medium.com/u/d00f1e6b06a2) I didn’t think twice and I’ve changed [my tiny dynamo library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaddb) to use this, one thing I’ve found is that if you are testing locally on [amazon/dynamodb-local](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/dynamodb-local/) you might want to require(‘http’) instead of https.
